The CNN for COVID-19 Image Dataset project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a dataset specifically curated to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The dataset includes images labeled with COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal conditions. The CNN architecture is designed to extract and learn spatial features from the images, enabling the model to distinguish between these conditions effectively. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis, aiming to aid in the automated diagnosis of COVID-19 using X-ray imagery.
